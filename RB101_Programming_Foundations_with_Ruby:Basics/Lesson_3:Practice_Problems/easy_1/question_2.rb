# Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

# ! is a not operator and usually used to to indicate something is mutating
# ? helps with readibility; and used in a ternary

5.  result if boolean is true/false
6. !! returns false/true values depending on what you put it before
